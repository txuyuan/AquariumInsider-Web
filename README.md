# Aquarium Insider

\*Very much work-in-progress and very incomplete.

An broad information repository for everything aquarium, suitable for all sorts of experience levels, with beginner guide and refreshers for veterans.

<br/><br/>

## Dev Setup

First, ensure you are running nodeJS 16 (using older versions can&will cause issues with nuxt)

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.
Optionally, there is also an untested Dockerfile for deploying on NodeJS. It is untested, so alter it and try it at your own risk
