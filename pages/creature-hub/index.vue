    <p>
      Here, you can find important general information about most of the aquatic
      life you can/will put in an aquarium, including their physical
      specifications, requirements for food, water, company, as well as a
      general description. We are confident that this will be useful in guiding
      you on buying and taking care of plants and animals.

      However, if there is any important information not explicitly shown in
      this section that you feel should be considered, do search it up or
      consult an expert (like a fish store owner) and make sure you have your
      facts right. While we may not cover everything, we can assure you that all
      information put here <em>is</em> accurate.
