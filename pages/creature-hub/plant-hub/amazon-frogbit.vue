    <p>
      Another classic choice for floating plants in an aquarium. They wield
      broad and fat leaves and sport long, branching roots. These require little
      attention from the fishkeeper, and provide excellent shade for your fish,
      depending if they enjoy darkness or need hiding places. Do be warned that
      Frogbits often block out a considerable amount of light, impacting plants
      that live beneath it in your tank, so always plan ahead!
