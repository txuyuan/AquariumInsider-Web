    <p>
      An attractive plant with conspicuous leaves of variant colours, the Dwarf
      Aquarium Lily is relatively easy to care for, but is still quite picky
      when it comes to how it is grown. It must be subject to relatively bright
      lighting as well as tropical water temperatures. On top of all that, the
      bulb must be planted such that it is only partially submerged in the
      substrate, lest the plant die.
