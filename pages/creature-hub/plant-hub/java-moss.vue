    <p>
      Yet another absolute classic, the Java Moss is beloved by all for its
      insane adaptability and sheer ease to grow. It will happily grow on just
      about any surface, be it gravel, rock, driftwood or even vinyl. It grows
      well under a myriad of conditions and even without fertiliser, but prefers
      clean, well-circulated water and brighter lights. A great plant for a
      first time aquarist in general.
