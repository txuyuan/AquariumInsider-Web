    <p>
      Easily one of the easiest plants to care for, the common duckweed is a
      great option for smaller aquariums, mainly due to its very small leaves
      and short roots. Despite its small size however, this little bugger grows
      very quickly. You will have to replace it from time to time, or prune back
      its roots to a desirable length. Do ALWAYS keep a lid on your tank if you
      intend to keep it as it tends to spread its territory and grow outside of
      tanks, which can be VERY difficult to remove.

      Excellent for creating a moody ambience due to it only partially filtering
      out the light, it can give your tank a nice pond-like appearance. In all,
      it’s a great choice for beginners and veterans alike. Also effective at
      balancing your tank’s mineral content.
