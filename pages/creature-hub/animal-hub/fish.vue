        <h3>Cherry Barbs</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Scientific Name: <em>Puntius titteya</em></li>
          <li>Size: <em>&lt;2 inches</em></li>
          <li>Life Expectancy: <em>4-6 years</em></li>
          <li>Diet: <em>Omnivore</em></li>
          <li>Nature: <em>Peaceful, Suitable for community tanks</em></li>
          <li>Temperature: <em>23–26°C</em></li>
          <li>pH: <em>6.0 - 7.0</em></li>
          <li>Schooling: <em>Yes, 6+ (Minimum 25 Gallons)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Eye-catching, energetic and hardy, these bright red beauts are hard to
          beat when it comes to a newcomer’s choice for fish. With a peaceful
          temperament, these babies can coexist peacefully in community tanks.
          However, Cherry barbs are timid and skittish if they can’t find
          refuge, so provide plenty of hiding spots in the tank.

        <h3>Cory Catfish</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Scientific Name: <em>Corydoras paleatus</em></li>
          <li>Size: <em>1-4 inches</em></li>
          <li>Life Expectancy: <em>3-5 years</em></li>
          <li>Diet: <em>Omnivore (bottom feeders)</em></li>
          <li>Nature: <em>Peaceful</em></li>
          <li>Temperature: <em>21-25.5°C</em></li>
          <li>pH: <em>5.5 - 7.0</em></li>
          <li>Schooling: <em>No (Minimum 10 Gallons)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These bottom-dwelling catfish are one of the best community fish out
          there – they survive in most conditions, get along with virtually
          everything and are active and diurnal, meaning hours of fun. While
          they’re not schooling fish, feel free to place them in schools of 4-5,
          for a sense of security for the fish. They aren’t picky eaters, so
          feel free to choose between flakes and pellets, but do ensure these
          sink to the bottom before other fish nab it before these corys can.
          Because of their docile nature, keep Corys only with other peaceful
          species such as Tetras, Mollies, Plecos, and Danios.

        <h3>Goldfish</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Scientific Name: <em>Carassius auratus</em></li>
          <li>Size: <em>6-24 inches</em></li>
          <li>Life Expectancy: <em>10-15 years</em></li>
          <li>Diet: <em>Omnivore</em></li>
          <li>Nature: <em>Peaceful</em></li>
          <li>Temperature: <em>20-23°C</em></li>
          <li>pH: <em>7.0 - 8.4</em></li>
          <li>Schooling: <em>No (Minimum 30 Gallons)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          By far the most popular aquarium fish of all time, Goldfish virtually
          need no introduction. They come in many different varieties and
          colours, many of which are easy to keep. However, a major
          misconception is that Goldfish grow to suit their bowls. In reality
          these critters reach massive sizes regardless of their container, so
          be sure to house them appropriately, either in a big tank, or in an
          outdoor pond.

        <h3>Guppies</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Scientific Name: <em>Poecilia reticulata</em></li>
          <li>Size: <em>0.6-2 inches</em></li>
          <li>Life Expectancy: <em>&lt;2 years</em></li>
          <li>Diet: <em>Omnivore</em></li>
          <li>Nature: <em>Peaceful</em></li>
          <li>Temperature: <em>23-28°C</em></li>
          <li>pH: <em>6.8 - 7.6</em></li>
          <li>Schooling: <em>Yes, 5+ (Minimum 10 Gallons)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It’s no surprise that the guppy’s beautiful, flowing fins and colorful
          body make it a popular choice amongst aquarists. Being adaptable,
          low-cost and easy to care for, these livebearers are one of the best
          introductory fish for beginners out there. However, it is important to
          note that given their fast rate of reproduction, any aquarist must
          think ahead and plan on what to do with fry when they are inevitably
          born. It is recommended that tanks be stocked with a 1: 3 Male to
          Female ratio, in order to ensure less aggression between males when
          they try to fight for dominance.

      <div class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Mollies</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Scientific Name: <em>Poecilia sphenops</em></li>
          <li>Size: <em>3.5-4.5 inches</em></li>
          <li>Life Expectancy: <em>10-15 years</em></li>
          <li>Diet: <em>Omnivore</em></li>
          <li>Nature: <em>Peaceful</em></li>
          <li>Temperature: <em>22-25.5°C</em></li>
          <li>pH: <em>7.5 - 8.5</em></li>
          <li>Schooling: <em>Yes, 4+ (Minimum 20 Gallons)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Much like guppies, they are hardy livebearers known for their wide
          range of colours. Much like Guppies, Mollies thrive in most conditions
          and reproduce extremely quickly. That said, they are a bit larger and
          require a little more room. It is recommended that tanks be stocked
          with a 1:3 Male to Female ratio, in order to ensure less aggression
          between males when they try to assert dominance.

        <h3>Neon Tetra</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Scientific Name: <em>Paracheirodon innessi</em></li>
          <li>Size: <em>1-1.5 inches</em></li>
          <li>Life Expectancy: <em>6-8 years</em></li>
          <li>Diet: <em>Omnivore</em></li>
          <li>Nature: <em>Peaceful</em></li>
          <li>Temperature: <em>21-27°C</em></li>
          <li>pH: <em>6.0 - 7.0</em></li>
          <li>Schooling: <em>Yes, 6+. (Minimum 16 Gallons)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These tetras sport vibrant blue bodies with a striking red stripe from
          belly to tail. While small and unassuming, these hardy critters have
          low care needs. However, they still have high energy requirements and
          will spend the better part of a day darting around the tank in a
          shoal. These fish swim in the middle of the water column and enjoy
          playing and hiding in underwater vegetation. The more comfortable a
          neon tetra feels in its environment, the less frequently the fish will
          hide. In the wild, neon tetras live in tropical flowing waters, with
          dense vegetation that includes floating plants and roots. You should
          replicate this habitat in the tank by providing low-light hiding
          places for your neon tetra.
