      Much like guppies, they are hardy livebearers known for their wide range
      of colours. Much like Guppies, Mollies thrive in most conditions and
      reproduce extremely quickly. That said, they are a bit larger and require
      a little more room. It is recommended that tanks be stocked with a 1:3
      Male to Female ratio, in order to ensure less aggression between males
      when they try to assert dominance.
