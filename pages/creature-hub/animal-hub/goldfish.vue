      By far the most popular aquarium fish of all time, Goldfish virtually need
      no introduction. They come in many different varieties and colours, many
      of which are easy to keep. However, a major misconception is that Goldfish
      grow to suit their bowls. In reality these critters reach massive sizes
      regardless of their container, so be sure to house them appropriately,
      either in a big tank, or in an outdoor pond.
