      These tetras sport vibrant blue bodies with a striking red stripe from
      belly to tail. While small and unassuming, these hardy critters have low
      care needs. However, they still have high energy requirements and will
      spend the better part of a day darting around the tank in a shoal. These
      fish swim in the middle of the water column and enjoy playing and hiding
      in underwater vegetation. The more comfortable a neon tetra feels in its
      environment, the less frequently the fish will hide. In the wild, neon
      tetras live in tropical flowing waters, with dense vegetation that
      includes floating plants and roots. You should replicate this habitat in
      the tank by providing low-light hiding places for your neon tetra.
