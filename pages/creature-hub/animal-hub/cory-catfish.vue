    <p>
      These bottom-dwelling catfish are one of the best community fish out there
      – they survive in most conditions, get along with virtually everything and
      are active and diurnal, meaning hours of fun. While they’re not schooling
      fish, feel free to place them in schools of 4-5, for a sense of security
      for the fish. They aren’t picky eaters, so feel free to choose between
      flakes and pellets, but do ensure these sink to the bottom before other
      fish nab it before these corys can. Because of their docile nature, keep
      Corys only with other peaceful species such as Tetras, Mollies, Plecos,
      and Danios.
