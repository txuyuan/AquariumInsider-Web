      It’s no surprise that the guppy’s beautiful, flowing fins and colorful
      body make it a popular choice amongst aquarists. Being adaptable, low-cost
      and easy to care for, these livebearers are one of the best introductory
      fish for beginners out there. However, it is important to note that given
      their fast rate of reproduction, any aquarist must think ahead and plan on
      what to do with fry when they are inevitably born. It is recommended that
      tanks be stocked with a 1: 3 Male to Female ratio, in order to ensure less
      aggression between males when they try to fight for dominance.
