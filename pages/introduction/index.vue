    <p>
      The earliest aquarium was opened in 1853 as part of London Zoo. Since
      then, aquatic vivariums and terrariums have transitioned into a hobby
      enjoyed by all, regardless of environment or background. They can be
      scaled up and down to fit in everything from city apartments to mansions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus, they are inherently sealed environments, so they do not require you
      to make any changes to the rest of your home like some other pets may.
      Hence, they are easy to add to any home and give you a companion.
