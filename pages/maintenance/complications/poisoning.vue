    <h2 class="section__title">Poisoning</h2>

    <p>
      This varies from fish to fish, depending on the species, size and
      metabolism rate. Higher temperatures usually lead to higher metabolic
      rates, resulting in toxins acting faster. Poisoning could weaken the
      fishâ€™s immune system, which could lead to infections.

        <h3>Ammonia Poisoning</h3>

        The symptoms usually include:
        <ul>
          <li>Lethargy</li>
          <li>Hovering motionless at the bottom of the aquarium</li>
          <li>Red gills</li>
          <li>Lack of appetite</li>
        </ul>
        More severe examples are if you notice:
        <ul>
          <li>Bleeding gills</li>
          <li>External and/or internal bleeding</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To remedy such a situation, you can conduct a water change (25-50%),
          attempt to lower the pH through means such as commercial chemical pH
          adjusters, chemical filtration. For long term solutions, you can use
          reverse osmosis (RO) or deionized (DI) water when conducting water
          changes.

        <h3>Nitrite Poisoning</h3>

        <p>
          While not as toxic as Ammonia Poisoning, it is still deadly to fishes,
          especially in high doses or over long periods of time. Most symptoms,
          causes and treatments are similar to that of Ammonia Poisoning, with
          fish gasping for air at the water surface being another possible sign
          of nitrite poisoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than the common solutions in 'Recognising Complications', you
          can attempt 1 teaspoon of salt per 300 Gallons of water to help the
          fish to cope with nitrite toxins.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Carbon Dioxide Poisoning</h3>

        <p>
          This occurs when CO2 levels are in excess of 25-30 ppm, which is when
          it becomes dangerous for fish, which could lead to suffocation.
        </p>

        Symptoms include:
        <ul>
          <li>Rapid breathing</li>
          <li>Gasping for air</li>
          <li>Staggering swimming behaviour</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Causes could be caused by the malfunction of the CO2 reactor, lack of
          plants, or the inability of plants to absorb CO2 if the lighting is
          insufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          One solution is to heavily aerate the tank through surface agitation
          and air-stones. This will cause the CO2 to dissipate from the water
          resolving the complication.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Hydrogen Sulfite Poisoning</h3>

        <p>
          This happens rarely, usually when there is a severe lack of
          maintenance or an extended power outage, the malfunction of equipment
          could lead to hydrogen sulphite forming in the gravel or within the
          filter. Hydrogen sulfite transforms iron within the blood cells into
          sulphide which will lead to suffocation of the fish.
        </p>

        <p>
          Symptoms are similar to those of ammonia and nitrite poisoning, while
          also including a possible rotten egg like stench. The most important
          part of this is prevention, which means that cleaning is key in this
          regard. The gravel should be cleaned regularly and the filter has to
          be rinsed out well, in the case of a power outage, before restarting
          it.
        </p>

      <div class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Chlorine, Chloramine, Heavy Metal Poisoning</h3>

        <p>
          These complications are usually not a problem, due to the fact that
          water usually is treated with a conditioner prior to use. These
          chemicals are typically added to tap water to make it safe for human
          use, but they irritate the gills and block the oxygen carrying cells,
          leading to suffocation in fish. If Chlorine or Chloramine poisoning
          occurs, a chlorine odour can be detected alongside the fish gasping
          for air, Some medications and aquarium additives contain copper. As
          such these should be used with caution and you should ensure that they
          are not used over an extended period of time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Solutions for this problem include adding a water conditioner as soon
          as possible, as chlorine/chloramine can kill all fish within 24 hours.
          A high concentration of heavy metals can lead to abrupt death without
          warning signs. A good water conditioner will also remove heavy metals,
          alongside chlorine and chloramine.
