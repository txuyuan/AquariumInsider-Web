    <p>
      Infections could be caused by Fungal Bacteria, leading to Fungal
      Infections, which could occur when bacterial or parasitic infections are
      active. These infections typically feed on the fish itself, and can be
      seen from white cotton-like ‘furry’ growths on the skin, mouth, or fins.
      However, at times, these growths can be internal.
