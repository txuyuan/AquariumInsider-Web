    <h2>Water Conditions</h2>

    <p>
      The easiest way to check your fish tank water is to acquire an all-round
      tester kit. There are a few key things to look out for are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ammonia <strong>(IMPORTANT)</strong></li>
      <li>Nitrite <strong>(IMPORTANT)</strong></li>
      <li>Nitrate <strong>(IMPORTANT)</strong></li>
      <li>pH <strong>(IMPORTANT)</strong></li>
      <li>Phosphate</li>
      <li>KH</li>
      <li>GH</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These compounds will be kept largely in check with a good mechanical,
      chemical and biological filter. The balance is delicate however, so be
      sure to check your tank’s water health regularly.

        <h3>Ammonia</h3>

        <p>
          This is the top cause of fish death in aquariums. In an established
          aquarium, you should conduct an ammonia test and record it in a log
          once per week. Whether you own a saltwater or freshwater aquarium, the
          ammonia level should be 0.0ppm or undetectable. While a test kit could
          be used, you can also install an ammonia alert sensor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anytime a fish falls sick or deceases, be sure to check the ammonia
          levels in the tank for their cause of death.

      <div class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Nitrite</h3>

        <p>
          This is the product of the breakdown of ammonia, and is also toxic as
          a result, should be in concentrations no greater than 0.0ppm. Include
          nitrite testing in a monthly routine, as nitrite levels may fluctuate
          in ‘mini-cycles’ from time to time. If there is elevation in nitrite,
          it could be a sign of problems brewing in the tank.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Nitrate</h3>

        <p>
          This is the product of the breakdown of nitrites, but isn’t
          particularly dangerous. However, do watch for increased levels, as
          they could become toxic and stress fish. For freshwater tanks, nitrate
          should be kept at levels below 40ppm, with saltwater tanks generally
          requiring lower levels. An appropriate filter media and regular water
          changes are usually enough to keep nitrate levels down
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>pH</h3>

        <p>
          pH levels should generally be around 6.5 to 7.5 for freshwater fish,
          while saltwater fish may thrive in a pH upwards of 8. Do remember to
          do research on the pH levels required for your species of fish. A pH
          alert sensor can be used, alongside a test kit, to ensure that pH
          levels are kept at an appropriate range.
