      aquarium long term. While completing the initial setup may seem to be

      This is mainly in 2 sections, passive and active maintenance. Passive
      maintenance refers to simply maintaining a liveable environment and

      refers to actively seeking out potential issues, like diseases and
      infections. A combination of both will keep your aquarium alive and
      healthy
