    <p>
      Even if the water looks clear, there are still particles of food and waste
      still present. This not only causes a buildup of visible, physical waste,
      but also issues with nitrogen and phosphate levels. Algae could possibly
      grow, and oxygen levels may drop, which could cause aquatic life to fall
      sick or get stressed.

    <p>
      Water changes should take place around once every week, but not too often
      as this may rid the tank of the beneficial bacteria colony that serves as
      your biofilter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When changing the water for an aquarium, you should change around 10-15%
      of the water content for a smaller tank (5-10 gallons). For larger fish
      tanks, or if it is heavily stocked, 20-25% of the water should be changed.

    <h3>The Process:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The water. Firstly, remember to prepare the water that you will be using
        as replacement. Tap water is fine, but be sure to allow it to sit for a
        few days, and follow the tips of dechlorination stated above (This is
        Important, as chlorine WILL KILL your fishes). It is best if the water
        that you are adding is the same temperature as the water in the
        aquarium. This is to reduce the stress for fishes. If you are
        maintaining a saltwater aquarium, follow instructions on your aquarium
        salts to reach appropriate salinity levels for the fish. You can do this
        in advance and store the water.
      </li>

      <li>
        Gather your supplies. This should be done before you begin changing the
        water. Supplies required include:
        <ul>
          <li>Sponges</li>
          <li>Gravel/sand siphon</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Cleanup. Siphon the debris at the bottom of the tank to get rid of some
        of the detritus that has accumulated since the last water change. Do
        this slowly so as to not harm your fish. Use the sponge to gently remove
        any buildup on the glass inside your fish tank. Repeat this process a
        few times to ensure debris gets cleared up.
      </li>

      <li>
        Slowly and gradually add in the amount of water you removed after
        cleaning. Test the water to ensure that you reach the appropriate pH and
        saline levels. Plug your filter in to remove any remaining debris
        floating around.
      </li>
    </ol>
