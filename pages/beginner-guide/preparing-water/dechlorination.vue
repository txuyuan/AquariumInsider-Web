    <p>
      Chlorine is toxic to all fish, causing severe gill damage, leading to
      asphyxiation and death. There is no effective treatment for chlorine
      poisoning in fish, so exposure is likely a death sentence. Therefore, it
      is important to always treat your water.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="warning">IMPORTANT!</span>
      This is not applicable if your water is treated with chloramine, in which
      case a filtration system is the only option.

        <h3>Dechlorinator</h3>

        <p>
          Before adding fresh water from the tap into the tank, dechlorinate it
          using a store bought dechlorinator, 5-10 minutes prior to moving it to
          the tank. For larger tanks that require a hose pump to refill the tank
          water, do add the dechlorinator at intervals to prevent overdose.

        <h3>Home Solution</h3>

        <p>
          In the event that there is no dechlorinator available, and the water
          from your tap is treated with chlorine, leave the water to air for at
          least 24 hours before adding the water to the tank. This minimises the
          concentration of chlorine as it will “bubble off” since it is
          volatile, and make it safe for fish.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this solution is still tenable, a dechlorinator is always
          preferred.
