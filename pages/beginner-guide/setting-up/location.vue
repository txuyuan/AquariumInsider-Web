    The placement of an aquarium impacts not only the amount of joy derived from
    it, but also the aquarium's overall success. A few factors for consideration
    are:
    <ul>
      <li>Visibility - Can you see it?</li>
      <li>Proximity to Electrical and water supply</li>
      <li>Temperature of the area</li>
      <li>Lighting of the area - Direct sunlight encourages algae growth</li>
      <li>
        Support - Can the location a heavy tank? Aquarium stands can be used if
        not
      </li>
    </ul>
