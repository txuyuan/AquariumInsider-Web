    <p>
      Substrate is not actually an essential part of an aquariumn. Bare-bottomed
      tanks are absolutely a 'thing', but having a substrate brings about more
      pros than cons.

    <ol>
      <li>Good looking</li>
      <li>
        Natural - By having a substrate, you are creating a more natural
        environment for your fish
      </li>
      <li>
        Enhances your fish visually - You can use substrate to make your fish
        pop, especially if the substrate colour and your fishes' colour
        contrasts
      </li>
      <li>
        Houses bacteria - You know those beneficial bacteria that take part in
        the nitrogen cycle? While the majority of them live in your filter, some
        also cover the substrate of your aquarium. In fact, you can use the
        substrate from an established tank to make your brand new aquarium cycle
        faster
      </li>
      <li>
        Plants need it - Plant roots need to go somewhere. Without a substrate,
        your plants will float to the top of your tank.
      </li>
