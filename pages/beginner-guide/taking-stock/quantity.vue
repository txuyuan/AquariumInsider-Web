      >One-inch per Gallon Rule: Recommended 1 inch of fish per 1/2 gallons of
      water</span
    >

    <p>
      This is a widely rule known rule that is a good guide. However, it leaves
      plenty of room for error. It does not account for modern filtration
      systems, the types of fish, live plants or proper lighting.
    </p>

    <h3>Factors to account for</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Different fishes have different requirements, from amount of waste to
        swimming room required to stay healthy
      </li>
      <li>Fishes will grow, so their space requiremenets will change</li>
      <li>
        The volume of the aquarium is not the same as the water capacity, as
        decor & equipment take up space
      </li>
      <li>
        Keeping too few of schooling fishes can cause stress and a shorter
        lifespan
      </li>
    </ol>
