    <h2>Fish Compatibility</h2>

    This is mainly relevant for community tanks, where fish and other aquatic
    life are housed together. There are a few important points to note:
    <ul>
      <li>Saltwater/freshwater compatibility</li>
      <li>Space requirements</li>
      <li>Different levels of fish (bottom, mid-level, surface feeders)</li>
      <li>Willingness to be with others of the same/different species</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Be sure to ask the fish store about compatibility before purchasing, and
      so some additional research on the species
