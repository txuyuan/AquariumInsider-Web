    <p>
      Getting a healthy fish in the first place is obviously the best way to
      keep your fish healthy. These are 6 important signs to look out for
      healthy fish which you can use as a cursory check
    </p>

        <h3>Active</h3>
        <p>
          It's a good sign if the fish is swimming around peacefully. If they
          are hiding, laying on the bottom, floating, or struggling to keep
          themselves up, they may be ill.
        </p>
        <p>However, some species do not swim around much regardless.</p>

      <span class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Responsive to Food</h3>
        <p>
          Healthy fish usually respond promptly to food, reaction to it being a
          good indicator for stress and hence health.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, some fish are just timid eaters, and fish new to an aquarium
          will often not accept food for the first few days.
        </p>

      <span class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Gill Movement</h3>
        <p>
          Healthy fish usually move their gills regularly but not rapidly.
          Taking in water too slowly or rapidly could indicate health issues
        </p>
      </span>
      <span class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>Full Fins, Normal Eyes, Bright Colours</h3>
        <p>A damaged fish fin is at risk of fungal infection</p>
        <p>
          Bulging eyes are called "popeye" and are a sign of underlying health
          problems
        </p>
        <p>
          Fish become dull if stressed from illness, ammonia poisoning, or
          improper water parameters
        </p>
      </span>
      <span class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>No white spots</h3>
        <p>
          A white powder covering the fish is likely ich; an extremely common
          aquatic parasite
        </p>
      </span>
      <span class="tiled-cards__card">
        <h3>No sick tank-mates</h3>
        <p>
          Fish may spread sickness to others in the same tank. It's best to
          avoid a fish with a sick tank-mate, unless you are willing to medicate
          the fish on arrival
