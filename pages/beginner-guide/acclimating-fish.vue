    <p>
      While some beginner fish like guppies or bettas might survive the simple
      "Float'n'dump", this is not the proper acclimation method. Acclimating a
      fish includes parameters like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temperature</li>
      <li>Mineral content</li>
      <li>Mineral type</li>
      <li>PH</li>
      <li>KH</li>
      <li>GH</li>
      <li>Salinity (possibly)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      However, a proper acclimation can be very simple and involves simply a
      slow drip from the main tank into a bowl of your fish. You can buy
      "acclimation kits" online, but we have a simple DIY option.

        <h3>The DIY option</h3>

        Materials:
        <ul>
          <li>Small bendable tube for use as a siphon</li>
          <li>Rubber band or similiar to kink the tube</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Start the siphon of water from the main tank to the bowl with your
          fish. Now kink the tube with the rubber band so that the drip rate is
          about 1 drop per sescond. Wait NO LESS than 20 minutes.
